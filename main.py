"""
Main entry point for running GitGuard AI.

This script demonstrates the full application lifecycle:
1. Starts the graph with a PR.
2. Reviewer Agent fetches diff and proposes comments.
3. Execution pauses (HITL) for human verification.
4. User reviews comments in the console and approves/rejects.
5. Graph resumes to post comments to GitHub (if approved).
